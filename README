The main Fortran cDFT code is
"dftpm_2state_impls_varbl_aaspec_1wtrM.f"

Results are collected in sub-directories, with (hopefully)
rather obvious names.
Monomer and state probability profiles are
denoted "fccdfil" and "Pdistr", respectively.
Those obtained at coexistence are specifically saved
so that (say)
"fcdg_T2.96316"
implied the monomer density profile of the thin phase
in coexistence with a thick phase at a reduced temperature of 2.96316.
"fcdl_T2.96316" is the coexisting monomer density profile of the thick phase.
Log files with other data are saved as
"tg_T2.96316" (thin phase)
etc.
